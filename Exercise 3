#Write a Python function named print_diamond that takes an odd integer n as an argument and prints a diamond shape with a width of n using the * character.
#For n = 5, the output should be:
#    *     4   1
#   ***    3   3
#  *****   2   5  
#   ***    3   3
#    *     4   1
#Note: If an even number is passed, the function should return "Please provide an odd integer."
